	abstract = {Since its experimental discovery, many phenomenological theories successfully reproduced the rapid rise of the Hall number nH, going from p at low doping to 1+p at the critical doping p∗ of the pseudogap in superconducting cuprates. Further comparison with experiments is now needed in order to narrow down candidates. In this paper, we consider three previously successful phenomenological theories in a unified formalism—an antiferromagnetic mean field (AF), a spiral incommensurate antiferromagnetic mean field (sAF), and the Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) theory. We find a rapid rise in the specific heat and a rapid drop in the Seebeck coefficient for increasing doping across the transition in each of those models. The predicted rises and drops are locked, not to p∗, but to the doping where antinodal electron pockets, characteristic of each model, appear at the Fermi surface shortly before p∗. While such electron pockets are still to be found in experiments, we discuss how they could provide distinctive signatures for each model. We also show that the range of doping where those electron pockets would be found is strongly affected by the position of the van Hove singularity.},

	abstract = {In this article, I review progress towards an understanding of the normal state (in-plane) transport properties of high- T c cuprates in the light of recent developments in both spectroscopic and transport measurement techniques. Against a backdrop of mounting evidence for anisotropic single-particle lifetimes in cuprate superconductors, new results have emerged that advocate similar momentum dependence in the transport decay rate Γ( k ). In addition, enhancement of the energy scale (up to the bare bandwidth) over which spectroscopic information on the quasiparticle response can be obtained has led to the discovery of new, unforeseen features that, surprisingly, may have a significant bearing on the transport properties at the dc limit. With these two key developments in mind, I consider here whether all the ingredients necessary for a complete phenomenological description of the anomalous normal state transport properties of high- T c cuprates are now in place.},

	abstract = {Although the vast majority of high-Tc cuprate superconductors are hole-doped, a small family of electron-doped compounds exists. Underinvestigated until recently, there has been tremendous recent progress in their characterization. A consistent view is being reached on a number of formerly contentious issues, such as their order-parameter symmetry, phase diagram, and normal-state electronic structure. Many other aspects have been revealed exhibiting both their similarities and differences with the hole-doped compounds. This review summarizes the current experimental status of these materials. This information is synthesized into a consistent view on a number of topics important to both this material class and the overall cuprate phenomenology including the phase diagram, the superconducting order-parameter symmetry, electron-phonon coupling, phase separation, the nature of the normal state, the role of competing orders, the spin-density wave mean-field description of the normal state, and pseudogap effects.},

	abstract = {The mechanism by which the Fermi surface of high- T c cuprates undergoes a dramatic change from a large hole-like barrel to small arcs or pockets on entering the pseudogap phase remains a question of fundamental importance. Here we calculate the normal-state Hall coefficient from the resonating-valence-bond spin-liquid model developed by Yang, Rice and Zhang. In this model, reconstruction of the Fermi surface occurs via an intermediate regime where the Fermi surface consists of both hole- and electron-like pockets. We find that the doping ( x ) dependence of the Hall number transitions from \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0295-5075/113/2/27003/epl17651ieqn1.gif] \$1+x\$ to ( x ) over this narrow doping range. At low temperatures, a switch from a downturn to an upturn in the Hall coefficient signals the departure of the electron-like pockets from the Fermi surface.},
